# Contributing to Artichoke ‚Äì Project Infrastructure

üëã Hi and welcome to [Artichoke]. Thanks for taking the time to contribute!
üí™üíéüôå

Artichoke aspires to be a Ruby 2.6.3-compatible implementation of the Ruby
programming language. [There is lots to do].

project-infrastructure is infrastructure as code configuration for Artichoke on
GitHub, AWS, and other platforms.

If Artichoke does not run Ruby source code in the same way that MRI does, it is
a bug and we would appreciate if you [filed an issue so we can fix it]. [File
bugs specific to project-infrastructure in this repository].

If you would like to contribute code to project-infrastructure üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª, find an
issue that looks interesting and leave a comment that you're beginning to
investigate. If there is no issue, please file one before beginning to work on a
PR. [Good first issues are labeled `E-easy`].

## Setup

project-infrastructure includes Ruby, Terraform, and Text sources. Developing on
project-infrastructure requires configuring several dependencies.

### Terraform

The Artichoke project infrastructure depends on [Terraform] 0.14.

On macOS, you can install Terraform with [Homebrew]:

```console
$ brew install terraform@0.14
```

### Ruby

project-infrastructure requires a recent Ruby and [bundler] for development
tasks. The [`.ruby-version`](.ruby-version) file in this repository specifies
the preferred Ruby toolchain.

If you use [RVM], you can install Ruby dependencies by running:

```sh
rvm install "$(cat .ruby-version)"
gem install bundler
```

If you use [rbenv] and [ruby-build], you can install Ruby dependencies by
running:

```sh
rbenv install "$(cat .ruby-version)"
gem install bundler
rbenv rehash
```

The [`Gemfile`](Gemfile) in this repository specifies several dev dependencies.
You can install these dependencies by running:

```sh
bundle install
```

[rvm]: https://rvm.io/
[rbenv]: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv
[ruby-build]: https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build

project-infrastructure uses [`rake`](Rakefile) as a task runner. You can see the
available tasks by running:

```console
$ bundle exec rake --tasks
rake bundle:audit:check           # Checks the Gemfile.lock for insecure dependencies
rake bundle:audit:update          # Updates the bundler-audit vulnerability database
rake fmt                          # Format sources
rake fmt:terraform                # Format Terraform sources with terraform fmt
rake fmt:text                     # Format text, YAML, and Markdown sources with prettier
rake format                       # Format sources
rake format:terraform             # Format Terraform sources with terraform fmt
rake format:text                  # Format text, YAML, and Markdown sources with prettier
rake lint                         # Lint sources
rake lint:rubocop                 # Run RuboCop
rake lint:rubocop:autocorrect     # Auto-correct RuboCop offenses
rake lint:terraform               # Lint Terraform sources
rake release:markdown_link_check  # Check for broken links in markdown files
rake terraform:providers:lock     # Lock terraform providers on all plaforms in all environments
```

To lint Ruby sources, project-infrastructure uses [RuboCop]. RuboCop runs as
part of the `lint` task. To run RuboCop by itself, invoke the `lint:rubocop`
task.

```console
$ bundle exec rake lint
$ bundle exec rake lint:rubocop
```

### Node.js

Node.js is an optional dependency that is used for formatting text sources with
[prettier].

Node.js is only required for formatting if modifying the following filetypes:

- `md`
- `yaml`
- `yml`

You will need to install [Node.js].

On macOS, you can install Node.js with [Homebrew]:

```sh
brew install node
```
